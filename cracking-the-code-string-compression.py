# Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeted characters.
# If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, 
# your method should return the original string.

# input: 'aabcccccaaa'
# output: 'a2b1c5a3'
# input: 'lmaooo'
#     -> 'l1m1a1o3'
# output: 'lmaooo'
